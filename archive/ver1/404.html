<h2>How did you get here?</h2>
<p>In the time of writing this, it's 3:52AM (edit: 4:18AM) and it's virtually impossible to get to this page unless I made an absolute fuck up.<br><br>Anyways, how have you been doing? I'm doing not so great.<br> I hate myself right now and regret so many things but I know it's impossible to turn back time to make the right choice. I should have sticked to my original intent and not take the path that my parents suggested. I talked myself into thinking that going to a arguably better place will lead to great things like meeting the people I have hoped for and learn the things I dreamed of doing but it's nothing but empty lies. I knew deep down that there was an uncomfortable tug, telling me that it's not the right decision...<br><br><br>I want to go home... but my home is nowhere.<br><br><br>A 404 Error page, a critical error in life. Know that for any mistake you make in life and online, they'll never go away but hidden. Learn from the mistakes made, and slowly cherish those moments as what Bob Ross would say, 'happy accidents'<br><br><br><br>Take the next step by returning to the <a href="https://sato-koyama.github.io/">Index</a> and take a note that I'm not perfect. No one is. I love y'all and I hope your 404 Erorr page was a short stay.<br>If you feel like telling me how you got here so that I can fix it in the future, submit an issue or something to the <a href="https://github.com/sato-koyama/sato-koyama.github.io/issues">github</a> (yes, it exists) and I'll get on it. Thanks.</p>
