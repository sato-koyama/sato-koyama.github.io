			<h3 class="content_text">September 26, 2020. What is this website?</h3>
			<p class="content_text">
				Basically, this is where you and I can see all the projects I have worked/been working on. At this point in time, I'm hard-coding the logs because I think I need SQL and php to set up a database and then do stuff from there (the biggest problem is creating the database that's permanently up and NOT localhost for security reasons.) I thought that I can cheat the system by just making a local textfile and then just reading it off that but there's a couple of issues so I'm still looking for solutions that doesn't cost me anything.
			</p>
			<p class="content_text">
				Onto the content, I'll either transcribe the projects into a format that's readable on this website or not and be lazy by just uploading a link to an exported file (since most of the notes are on my tablet.) I'm still thinking how I should format the images because it'll get clunky over time, so bear with this for now. Whatever it is, I thought a website would be an interesting way to keep track of the progress rather than not saying anything (or make videos for them.) 
			</p>
			<p class="content_text">
				By the way, there will definitely be a lot of easter eggs <a style="text-decoration:none;color:white;" href="images/ncb.png">on</a> this website. I haven't created any so far but it's coming, ranging from small little pop-ups to full blown webpages, i don't know what else there is to say. Oh, actually, you can click on the header image to see who the <a style="text-decoration: underline;color:white;" href="https://twitter.com/ree_kkr" target="_blank">illustrator</a> is. I put that there temporarily but it's starting to grow on me. I'll have to change it later but it's there for now. Also if you didn't realize, the header title changes every time you load the page. It's randomized based on a simple javascript so there's no weighting what appears... yet (could be interesting to add weighted chance).
			</p>
			<p class="content_text">
				Okay that's all from me. I'll <i>probably</i> make a video soon about this but I do have to do some studies to keep track.

			<p class="content_text">
				This is the logo I'm just running with for now. It's also a running brand of clothes that are comfy. As to why it's called Pascal? I don't know. I guess studying engineering takes a toll on people to name things based on engineering things lol. These are quick sketches while I was on my bed, sleep deprived and procrastinating to do work btw. So that's pretty cool.

			<h3 class="content_text">Sep 26, 2020. Testing</h3>
			<p class="content_text">
				This is just a test paragraph where I'm just writing stuff as filler because lorem ipsum is just a consistent blob of text which I know won't be the case. Anyways, the weather is nice from my room... I don't have a window. Here's multiple images of chak. I want to add hidden easter eggs in the future.
