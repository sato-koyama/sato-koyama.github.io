			<h3 class="content_text">09/26/20. Why not social media/make-a-website for this?</h3>
			<img src="images/pfp.jpg" class="content_image ">
			<p class="content_text">
				I completely forgot to mention in the video and in here why I chose not to make something like twitter or facebook, whatever social media. It's because I don't like <a href="secret/sm.txt" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: white;">social media.</a> The idea of it is shallow, so it's not worth it. I won't make one even at the cost of not being able to interact with people. Besides, if you want to contact me, you know where to do so. 
			</p>
			<p class="content_text">
				Also, I can do fancy <a href="https://gyazo.com/376ca3f751c1d8c0c67dc2db30d23b87" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;color:#abcdef;">stuff</a> and completely personalise it. Yeah, I could go onto those websites like wix or wordpress, but then the domain would contain their respective url and that sucks. What also sucks is that you don't have complete control over it as well (wix forces ad in footer or something.) What also also sucks is that there'll be no sense of creation if I'm not making it from scratch. Using a template and stuff is lame, even if it's easier.
			</p>
			<p class="content_text">
				All in all, I prefer to have control over my stuff. With github, at least I get to do anything I want (except domain name 'cuz that requires purchasing or somehow finding a free one which I can't be bothered to do.)

			<h3 class="content_text">Sep 26, 20. Rejected Projects 1 - Impostor Sydrome</h3>
			<p class="content_text">
				A week or so ago, I made a short comedic story about imposter syndrome. The plan was to write it, edit, and then  publish as most projects go... this didn't happen for one main reason. I think the humor was too dark in this one.

				It had a sort of obvious punchline and the payoff wasn't really funny at the end so I decided, "yeah. this one is pretty stupid." And decided to drop it.
			</p>
			<p class="content_text">
				I'll just give a summary of how the story went.<br>
				> Person suffers from severe impostor syndrome. No confidence, low self-esteeem, comparing others and feeling left behind.<br>
				> Tasks person does seem to amount to nothing. Having trouble working because of internal violent conflict.
				> Other people believe in person's efforts but person feels guilty.<br>
				> Wake up to another loud noise.<br>
				> Can't vent the sentiments, must make everyone think person is fine, even though person is fake.<br>
				> Kill people<br>
				> Kill increases confidence, higher self-esteem, no more comparing if no one to compare. Syndrome is pushed by constructs of society, therefore killing society means no more syndrome equal happy.<br>
				> Person is An Impostor.<br>
				> it was an <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: red; font-style: italic;" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/">Among Us</a> joke.

			<h3 class="content_text">Saturday, September 26, 2020. What is this website?</h3>
			<p class="content_text">
				Basically, this is where you and I can see all the projects I have worked/been working on. At this point in time, I'm hard-coding the logs because I think I need SQL and php to set up a database and then do stuff from there (the biggest problem is creating the database that's permanently up and NOT localhost for security reasons.) I thought that I can cheat the system by just making a local textfile and then just reading it off that but there's a couple of issues so I'm still looking for solutions that doesn't cost me anything.
			</p>
			<p class="content_text">
				Onto the content, I'll either transcribe the projects into a format that's readable on this website or not and be lazy by just uploading a link to an exported file (since most of the notes are on my tablet.) I'm still thinking how I should format the images because it'll get clunky over time, so bear with this for now. Whatever it is, I thought a website would be an interesting way to keep track of the progress rather than not saying anything (or make videos for them.) 
			</p>
			<p class="content_text">
				By the way, there will definitely be a lot of easter eggs <a style="text-decoration:none;color:white;" href="images/ncb.png">on</a> this website. I haven't created any so far but it's coming, ranging from small little pop-ups to full blown webpages, i don't know what else there is to say. Oh, actually, you can click on the header image to see who the <a style="text-decoration: underline;color:white;" href="https://twitter.com/ree_kkr" target="_blank">illustrator</a> is. I put that there temporarily but it's starting to grow on me. I'll have to change it later but it's there for now. Also if you didn't realize, the header title changes every time you load the page. It's randomized based on a simple javascript so there's no weighting what appears... yet (could be interesting to add weighted chance).
			</p>
			<p class="content_text">
				Okay that's all from me. I'll <i>probably</i> make a video soon about this but I do have to do some studies to keep track.

			<h3 class="content_text">09-26-2020. What's up with the favicon?</h3>
			<img src="images/Pascal.png" class="content_image">
			<p class="content_text">
				This is the logo I'm just running with for now. It's also a running brand of clothes that are comfy. As to why it's called Pascal? I don't know. I guess studying engineering takes a toll on people to name things based on engineering things lol. These are quick sketches while I was on my bed, sleep deprived and procrastinating to do work btw. So that's pretty cool.

				This is just a test paragraph where I'm just writing stuff as filler because lorem ipsum is just a consistent blob of text which I know won't be the case. Anyways, the weather is nice from my room... I don't have a window. Here's multiple images of chak. I want to add hidden easter eggs in the future.
