	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p><strong>I'll get this out of the way because I hate self-introductions...</strong><br>
	I'm Sato, I was born in Canada, June 2001, Japanese parents yada yada. I think that's all there is I have to say.<br>
	I love creating things, like problem solving, video games, robots, anime/manga, arts and photography, and food.<br>
	So, to make things a bit clear, The portfolio should show: my completed projects/feats, technical background (what I can do or need to improve on), and work related (if anyone wants me) enquiries. Here is more chill, with just daily life things and who I am I guess.<br>
	Also, I've been recommended by many friends to plug my links but it's a bit unfortunate because I have little to no social media conteacts. I'm not that social and interactive I suppose... I mainly use discord to talk to my friends and such so it's a bit eh... I do have twitter though and I'll probably use this website to make a long blog-esque diary entry thing so that I can keep track of things.<br>
	Also also, if (big if) you feel like support a small creator like me, I'll always appreciate it. Thank you for those who are or was supporting me. Thank you so much.<br>
