UPDATE (NOV 27 2019):
* completely remaking the code because styling was a pain when i made roundabout ways to make it work.


Building a website for future purposes.

- Publish projects EDIT(April 20 2019 21:28): that will require me to work on the projects...
- Create a blog-esque thing EDIT(April 20 2019 21:27): it's coming... just after I finish other projects such as that video I promised(?) to make during mid-sem break.
- Make an online portfolio for myself EDIT(April 20 2019 21:26): I do need things to put in my portfolio...
- Sleep better EDIT(April 20 2019 21:27): lol


TODO LIST:
* Make slideshow-esque thing on main
* Do my linear algebra assignment
* Actually get the main to be polished --> that is color schemes and stuff, i thought palitra was good???
* Do my physics advanced 1 assignment
* Create the other pages that are supposed to be there but instead greeted with the void
* Question why i wake up every morning feeling as though that i'm playing a certain character and feast upon immeasurable loneliness and existential crisis
* Organize the code neatly with comments(!) for nerds to be pleased with
* make a patreon so that I have enough money to survive, of course, i have nothing to provide so it's basically a donation system(?)
* Design images for the website to be more cohesive(?), im not sure, maybe having it chaotic as it is now is trending.
* Work on the engineering systems design project and (fuck you) matlab scripts
* Probably make a footer thing with (C) and publication things just in case, idk
