UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE (MAR 14 2022):
* cleaned up some stuff. Now it looks clean.
* uploaded all the videos i made that were fine.
* added a cool popup (about me) when you click on the cat.
* added a link to my github profile when you click on the title
* added a kofi link at the bottom of the timeline.
* fixed the error page, although no one will see it.

UPDATE UPDATE (SEP 26 2020):
* repurposing the whole website and format it similar to a twitter blog (don't like social media)
* it'll be fairly similar to a twitter timeline of a person and it'll mainly be about write-up of the projects (rejected and in progress)


UPDATE (NOV 27 2019):
* completely remaking the code because styling was a pain when i made roundabout ways to make it work.


Building a website for future purposes.

- Publish projects EDIT(April 20 2019 21:28): that will require me to work on the projects...
- Create a blog-esque thing EDIT(April 20 2019 21:27): it's coming... just after I finish other projects such as that video I promised(?) to make during mid-sem break.
- Make an online portfolio for myself EDIT(April 20 2019 21:26): I do need things to put in my portfolio...
- Sleep better EDIT(April 20 2019 21:27): lol


TODO LIST:
* Make slideshow-esque thing on main
* Actually get the main to be polished --> that is color schemes and stuff, i thought palitra was good???
* Create the other pages that are supposed to be there but instead greeted with the void
* Question why i wake up every morning feeling as though that i'm playing a certain character and feast upon immeasurable loneliness and existential crisis
* Organize the code neatly with comments(!) for nerds to be pleased with
* Design images for the website to be more cohesive(?), im not sure, maybe having it chaotic as it is now is trending.
* Probably make a footer thing with (C) and publication things just in case, idk
